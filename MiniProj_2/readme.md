**config.py** 
Contains the input path for the datasets.

**data_preprocessing.py**
Contains the preprocessing steps to process the csv 

**navie_bayes.py** 
Contains the implementation of Bernoulli Navie Bayes from scratch using a binomial data set.

**text_classification.py**
Contains the steps to train the reddit data with different classifiers. All the different classifiers are commented. We have uncommented multinomial binomial for the final submission as it has better accuracy.
This used data_preprocessing.py to pre-process the data.


**xlnet_reddit.ipynb**
Is the python note book that explains our final model that resulted in the better accuracy than every other algorithm we have used.
The note book took 5 hours on a 1050Ti GPU and a machine with 32 GB ram for training, so we have included the python notebook that showcases the results that we were able to achieve.
Please contact us if there are any questions related to the implementation.
